    "Q15 -  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "       Python's garbage collection (GC) system is an automated memory management mechanism that deallocates memory no longer used \n",
    "       by a program. It helps manage memory effectively by removing objects that are no longer accessible, ensuring that the program\n",
    "       does not run out of memory due to unused objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Key Components of Python's Garbage Collection-\n",
    "\n",
    "       #Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "       Each object in Python maintains a reference count, which tracks how many references point to that object.\n",
    "       When the reference count drops to zero (i.e., no variable or object points to it), the memory occupied by the object is\n",
    "       immediately deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "       #Cyclic Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "       Python uses a cyclic garbage collector to handle objects that reference each other, forming reference cycles that reference\n",
    "       counting alone cannot detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "       #Generational Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "        Python’s GC divides objects into three generations: generation 0, generation 1, and generation 2.\n",
    "        Newly created objects are placed in generation 0.\n",
    "        Objects that survive garbage collection in generation 0 are promoted to higher generations (1 and 2).\n",
    "        Higher generations are collected less frequently than lower generations because older objects are more likely to remain in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "       #Manual Control\n",
    "\n",
    "       Python provides the gc module for explicit control over garbage collection. For example:\n",
    "       Disable GC: gc.disable()\n",
    "       Enable GC: gc.enable()\n",
    "       Force collection: gc.collect()\n",
